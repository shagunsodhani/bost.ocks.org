<h1>On Scrolling</h1>

<p>Scrolling has become the primary form of interaction in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/12/30/year-in-interactive-storytelling/">interactive storytelling</a>, so much so that I occasionally joke my job title is Senior Scrolling Engineer rather than Graphics Editor. But cynacism aside, there are compelling reasons to use scrolling; for linear narratives — most content — it is generally the optimal mode of interaction.

<p>Yet scrolling is surprisingly nuanced and easy to break. As a reader, you have doubtless experienced poor scrolling behavior, ranging from mild annoyance to tab-closing frustration. Here’s my take on scrolling and how to use it effectively.

<h2><a href="#strengths" name="strengths">#</a>Scrolling’s Strengths</h2>

<p>Scrolling is ubiquitous and effortless. It is the most common mode of interaction on the web: we do it constantly. Even on this static web page, you have most likely already “interacted” with this page by scrolling while reading. You needn’t make a conscious effort to coordinate your hand and eye as you scan. Since we often can’t design content to fit in a typical browser window, and we don’t want to hide it behind tabs or buttons, scrolling is the most natural way of showing it.

<p>Scrolling is linear: you start at the top and progress continuously to the bottom. It is a single track with no branching, so the only choice the user must make is whether to go forward to new content or backward to content already seen. (Reducing choice is good, per <a href="http://www.sensible.com/dmmt.html"><i>Don’t Make Me Think</i></a>.) Since most narratives are linear, scrolling is a natural fit. And even pieces that encourage exploration typically have a primary path favored by the author.

<p>Scrolling is variable speed: the reader can progress as fast or slow as they like. In this sense scrolling allows random access; if your reader is bored she can peek ahead or to jump to another section. Often, visual scanning is faster than reading a table of contents.

<!-- no need for explicit pause, or lengthy animations between pages (remember those horrible page-flip catalog viewers?). reader stays engaged by continually advancing -->

<p>Scrolling supports many different modes of input: the mousewheel or touch pad, the arrow keys (right & down advance, left & up retreat), clicking the scroll bar or dragging the scroll thumb. And don’t forget the lesser-used keyboard controls: page up & page down or space & shift-space to jump by one window height, or command up & command down or home & end to jump instantly to the start or end.

<p>Perhaps most importantly, scrolling gives instantaneous visual feedback. It’s easy to see how your mouse, touch or keyboard input affects the viewport, and thus control how fast you are scrolling and in what direction. Scrolling is a form of direct manipulation.

<h2><a href="#challenges" name="challenges">#</a>Scrolling’s Challenges</h2>

<p>It is continuous

<p>Not an inherent disadvantage, but a challenge to present larger visual content. fine in many situations (like text or small images), but awkward if there are larger discrete chunks you want to scroll through, like large images, presentation slides, graphics or video.

<p>In these cases you might want to have a method to “snap” the content to the window, so that the content is not awkwardly cropped by the viewport

<h2><a href="#dont-break" name="dont-break">#</a>Don’t Break Scrolling</h2>

<p>How to display discrete pages of content, given that scrolling is continuous?

<p>Determine the display based on the current viewport, rather than trying to interpret mousewheel events directly. this way, it’s easier to not break scrolling. (keyboard commands, including the command-left or delete to go back; scrollbar, which provides visual feedback and allows direct manipulation of the viewport)

<p>Apple’s mac pro mousewheel-to-next-page gesture is a prime example of breaking scrolling: you have to wait for the animation to finish before it accepts another gesture, so you can't quickly interrupt the animation to go back a page, or skip ahead a page.

<p>Retain visual feedback while scrolling: e.g., text overlaid on video in Game of Shark & Minnow. if you find the free-floating text too loose, you could use a more minimal scroll indicator as in my stack presentation library. complement viewport indicator with discrete page indicator (ligety dots).

<p>Don’t interfere with default keyboard commands: command-{left,right} or delete.

<p>These previous versions had a flaw where you could still end up "between slides" — in the middle of a crossfade. to fix this, the latest version of the stack library uses a threshold to determine which page is visible, and then does a time-based (rather than viewport-based) transition.

<p>Don’t forget about mobile. given the ubiquity of screens and swipes in native apps, it’s ironic how difficult it is to implement screen swiping on the web. mobile safari doesn’t let javascript run during scroll.

<p>Visual indication of more content below. scroll > indicator, or some content partially visible. otherwise you risk the reader only seeing the cover. should only be necessary on the top page.

<p>Scroll-based triggers should not interrupt reading (e.g., autoplay video)

<p>Be careful about hiding content and preventing visual scanning (motorcycle helmets); it’s a trade-off between focus and breadth, like a pair of blinders

<h2><a href="#paternalism" name="paternalism">#</a>Avoid Paternalism</h2>

<p>Like autocorrupt

<p>“We know what you meant.” except, you don’t. and while automatic corrections are often helpful, they should always be accompanied by manual overrides for the cases where they are harmful.

<p>More generally, favoring the designer’s goals (such as beautiful images) over the user’s control. must be done carefully, with an eye not just to the desired goals, but with the incidental cost by removing control and frustrating the user.
